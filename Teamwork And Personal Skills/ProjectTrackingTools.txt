I decided to use Trello.com
It is way more intuitive and user friendly to me than the other options i have tried.
The UI is very nice and minimalistic and i like it that way.
I would recommend it to my friends if they ask me.
With my teammates from the java game project we used Trello to share some ideas and it was fun and easy to use.

That's all folks :)
