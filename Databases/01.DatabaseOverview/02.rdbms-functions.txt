RDBMS - Relational database management system

Relational databases are powerful because they require few assumptions about how data is related or how it will be extracted from the database. 
As a result, the same database can be viewed in many different ways. 

An important feature of relational systems is that a single database can be spread across several tables. 
This differs from flat-file databases, in which each database is self-contained in a single table. 

Almost all full-scale database systems are RDBMS's. Small database systems, however, use other designs that provide less flexibility in posing queries.
