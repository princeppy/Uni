A table is a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It consists of fields (columns), and rows.
A table has a specified number of columns, but can have any number of rows.[2] Each row is identified by one or more values appearing in a particular column subset. 
The columns subset which uniquely identifies a row is called the primary key.
Table is another term for relation; although there is the difference in that a table is usually a multiset (bag) of rows where a relation is a set and does not allow duplicates. 
Besides the actual data rows, tables generally have associated with them some metadata, such as constraints on the table or on the values within particular columns.
