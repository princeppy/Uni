                <h3>The Hunter</h3>

                <p class="readmore"><a href="#">READ MORE</a></p>

                <p class="content"> There are two different versions of the Orion myth, depending on the identity of his parents. The
                    first of these identifies the sea-god Neptune as Orion's father and the the great huntress Queen
                    Euryale of the Amazons as his mother. Orion inherited her talent, and became the greatest hunter in
                    the world. Unfortunately for him, with his immense strength came an immense ego, and he boasted that
                    he could best any animal on earth. In response to his vanity, a single small scorpion stung him and
                    killed him.
                </p>

                <p class="content"> Another version of the Orion myth states that he had no mother but was a gift to a pious peasant
                    from Jupiter, Neptune, and Mercury. <span>"Orion supposedly was able to walk on water and had greater
                    strength and stature than any other mortal. A skilled blacksmith, he fabricated a subterranean
                    palace for Vulcan. He also walled in the coasts of Sicily against the encroaching sea and built a
                    temple to the gods there" (Magee, 48).</span></p>
